   <!--The above example is for adding a full cover image ,but if we want to repeat a image into small parts horizontally,
    I comment this code otherwise it will be mixed up with above code:
       body{
            background-image: url("https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.PlbPoJvRkM6QX6Q80S0I4AHaEK?w=322&h=181&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7");
            background-repeat: repeat-x;
           }
           (For vertically we use same code but make a change = repeat-y in the place of = repeat-x)-->
