                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

                    Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                    
                    Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
                    
                    Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

        <h1>JS</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is one of the most popular and widely used languages in the world. You can use JavaScript to add features such as animations, maps, games, forms, and more to your websites. JavaScript can also run on other platforms, such as servers, mobile devices, and desktop applications.

            If you want to learn JavaScript, there are many resources available online. One of them is the JavaScript Tutorial from W3Schools, which teaches you the basics and advanced topics of JavaScript with examples and exercises. Another one is the JavaScript section from MDN Web Docs, which provides a comprehensive reference and guide for JavaScript developers. You can also check out the What is JavaScript? article from MDN Web Docs, which gives you an overview of what JavaScript is and what it can do.
            
            I hope this helps you understand what JavaScript is. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I can also create some images related to JavaScript if you are interested. ðŸ˜Š
